This Quick Start deploys {partner-product-short-name}, an accelerated genomics analysis framework, on the AWS Cloud. It helps researchers, clinical teams, and medical centers adopt {partner-product-short-name} and run multiple standalone tools and pipelines for secondary and tertiary analysis of large-scale genomic data. You can analyze data for cancer sequencing projects, population studies, ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-seq), and more.  

The Quick Start builds an AWS environment that spans two Availability Zones for high availability, and provisions an AWS Batch compute environment for on-demand instances. The Quick Start environment includes {partner-product-short-name} G4dn instances with graphics processing units (GPUs) for hardware acceleration.
